Use the following API response and HTML placeholder to complete the required tasks:

API URL: http://api.nrelate.com/common/frontend_test_response.php

Placeholder: <div class="nr_related_placeholder"></div>



Tasks:

1) Set up the Ajax Call properly
	a. Make one Ajax request to the provided URL (to bypass Same-Origin Policy, you will need to use JSONP)
	b. Implement a nRelate object with a method called insert_html(), which will insert the response to the provided placeholder

2) Style the API response to match the attached mockups (1_a, 1_b, 1_c).
	a. Use Google Font's "Roboto" as font (https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Roboto)
	b. Color and image sizes don't have to be exact match, just use your own discretion
	c. Hover status are also provided in the mockups, so don't forget that part!

3) Come up with one more design of yours, the goal is to make the user experience as pleasant as possible
	a. You are required to use JavaScript manipulating the HTML structure
	b. You can add interactions as you want



Deliverables:

1) Your response should contain only ONE HTML file, ONE CSS file and ONE JavaScript file (library files don't count if used locally).

2) Keep in mind that the Ajax call can only be made ONCE, so you will need to think about how to present 4 widgets in one page

3) You have three hours, put all files in the same folder and send it back


Good Luck!
